/**
 * BankDatabaseSchema defines the bank database tables for Plutus.
 * 
 * It is a contract class that defines names of columns in each table. The contract class allows us
 * to use the same constants across all the other classes in the same package. This lets us change a
 * column name in one place and have it propagate throughout our code.
 * 
 * Each inner class is an abstract class defining the table name and column names and implements the
 * interface BaseColumns. The inner class inherits the primary key field, _ID, that some Android
 * classes such as cursor adaptors will expect it to have.
 * 
 * Or we can also use interface class in our case.
